## Find the output of the following pseudocode

### Pseudocode:

```
Integer a
Set a = 1
while (a < 5)
    a = a + 2
end while
Print a
```

---

### Python Code:

```python
a = 1
while a < 5:
    a = a + 2
print(a)
```

---

### Output:

Here, the loop keeps running as long as `a < 5`.  
Starting with `a = 1`, after two iterations, `a` becomes 5.  
So the total iterations are: **`2`**
